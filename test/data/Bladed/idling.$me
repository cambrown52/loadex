*** Note:   Turbine inertial properties incl. centre of mass appended to verification ($VE) file
*** Note:   Hydrodynamic Origin for hydrodynamics component on: Body at node 202 has been automatically initialised to global location:0,0,0,0,0,0
 This must correspond with the physical location of the hydrodynamic coordinate system origin in the flow solver used to supply the hydrodynamic coefficients
*** WARNING:   Not all hydrodynamic bodies have added mass interactions
*** WARNING:   No zero lift angle found. Foil section ID = Foil data set 1
*** WARNING:   Cannot find relevant gradients within polar range for Foil data set 1 to apply the linear fit method. Slope is set to: 6.28319.
*** Note:   Hydrodynamic drag coefficient is zero
*** Note:   Averaged number of iterations per full time step in fixed-step integrator: 0
